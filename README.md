# Lead-Scoring-Case-Study


# Problem Statement

A company called X-Education in the education industry produces leads from numerous sources and gives them to the sales staff. After contacting the leads, the sales staff attempts to convert them, however the current rate is just about 30%. Building a logistic regression model is necessary to provide a score of 0-100 for each lead, and the conversion rate must grow to about 80%.
